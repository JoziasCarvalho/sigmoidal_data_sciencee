# Jozias Carvalho
<sub>*Data Scientist* </sub>

As a experienced Data Scientist I combine analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, and attention to details. I focus on transforming large volumes of information into practical and innovative solutions. With a solid background in data analysis, algorithms and artificial intelligence, my goal is to help companies make smarter, more strategic decisions through powerful insights. I'm driven by curiosity and the challenge of finding hidden patterns in complex data, using cutting-edge tools and techniques. I believe in the power of data to drive real results and am always looking for new ways to innovate and improve processes.

My credentials include a course taken with a highly renowned professor in Brazil, who holds a master's degree in Space Science and Technology from the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA), an institution of higher education and advanced research ranked as one of the best and most prestigious engineering schools in Brazil, and an MBA in Project and Process Management from the Air Force University (UNIFA), Carlos Melo.
